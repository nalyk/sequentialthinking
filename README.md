## üî• PERSISTENT SEQUENCES USAGE

### üîç **FINDING YOUR SEQUENCES** (Most Important!)

**Never remember sequence IDs again!** Use powerful fuzzy search with Romanian/Russian support:

```javascript
// Search for sequences (fuzzy matching titles/descriptions)
{
  "thought": "I need to find my analysis",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "searchSequence": {
    "query": "strategy",
    "limit": 10
  }
}

// NEW: Search within thought content using FTS
{
  "thought": "Find sequences containing specific thoughts",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "searchSequence": {
    "query": "market analysis",
    "limit": 10,
    "contentSearch": true
  }
}

// List all sequences (no query = show all)
{
  "thought": "Show me all my sequences",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "searchSequence": {
    "limit": 20
  }
}
```

**üåç Multilingual Support Examples:**

```javascript
// Romanian diacritics work perfectly
{
  "searchSequence": {
    "query": "strategie",  // finds "Strategia de dezvoltare"
    "limit": 10
  }
}

// Russian/Cyrillic also supported
{
  "searchSequence": {
    "query": "—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏—è",  // finds "–°—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑"
    "limit": 10
  }
}
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Normal thinking**: Use the tool as usual for sequential thinking
2. **Save sequence**: Add `saveSequence: { title: "My Analysis" }` to save your progress
3. **üîç Find sequence**: Use `searchSequence` to find your work (fuzzy search + content search!)
4. **Resume**: Use `loadSequence: { id: "found-sequence-id" }` to continue
5. **Automatic persistence**: All subsequent thoughts are automatically saved
6. **üéÜ NEW: Export/Import**: Use `exportSequence`/`importSequence` for backup/sharing

### Example: Saving a Sequence

```javascript
{
  "thought": "I've completed my initial analysis. Let me save this sequence.",
  "thoughtNumber": 5,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "saveSequence": {
    "title": "Product Strategy Analysis Q2 2025",
    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of our product strategy options"
  }
}
```

### Example: Searching for Sequences

```javascript
// Search by partial title/description
{
  "thought": "I need to find my product analysis work",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "searchSequence": {
    "query": "product",
    "limit": 10
  }
}

// Response shows matching sequences with titles, descriptions, and IDs
```

### Example: Exporting a Sequence

```javascript
// Export sequence as JSON for backup or sharing
{
  "thought": "I want to export my analysis for backup",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "exportSequence": {
    "id": "seq-abc123def456"
  }
}

// Response contains complete sequence data in JSON format
```

### Example: Importing a Sequence

```javascript
// Import sequence from JSON backup
{
  "thought": "I want to import my backed up analysis",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "importSequence": {
    "data": {
      "sequence": { /* sequence metadata */ },
      "thoughts": [ /* array of thoughts */ ]
    }
  }
}

// Response shows new sequence ID and import confirmation
```

### Example: Loading a Sequence

```javascript
// After finding the sequence ID through search
{
  "thought": "I want to continue my previous analysis.",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "loadSequence": {
    "id": "seq-abc123def456"  // From search results
  }
}
```

### Example: Continuing a Loaded Sequence

```javascript
{
  "thought": "Building on my previous analysis, I now see that we need to consider...",
  "thoughtNumber": 6,
  "totalThoughts": 8,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}
// This thought will be automatically saved to the active sequence
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING`: Set to "true" to disable colored thought logging to stderr
- `MAX_THOUGHT_HISTORY`: Maximum number of thoughts to keep in history (default: 1000)
- `MAX_BRANCHES`: Maximum number of branches to maintain (default: 50)
- `MAX_THOUGHTS_PER_BRANCH`: Maximum thoughts per branch (default: 100)

### Database Storage

The server automatically creates and manages a SQLite database at `dist/sequences.db` to store:

- **Sequences**: Metadata including title, description, creation date, and status
- **Thoughts**: Complete thought data with timestamps and sequence relationships
- **Automatic cleanup**: Old sequences and thoughts are managed according to configured limits
- **Cross-session persistence**: All data survives server restarts
