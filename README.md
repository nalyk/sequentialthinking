  <h1>Sequential Thinking MCP Server</h1>
  
Based on concepts from [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).
</div>

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process with enhanced memory management, type safety, verification workflows, and **persistent sequences** for long-term reasoning across sessions.

## Features

- **Structured Problem Solving**: Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Dynamic Revision**: Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens
- **Alternative Reasoning**: Branch into alternative paths of reasoning
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Generate and verify solution hypotheses with result tracking
- **ðŸ”¥ PERSISTENT SEQUENCES**: Save and load thinking sequences across sessions
- **ðŸ”¥ LONG-TERM REASONING**: Continue complex analysis over days or weeks
- **ðŸ”¥ AUTOMATIC PERSISTENCE**: Thoughts saved automatically when sequence is active
- **Memory Management**: Configurable limits prevent memory leaks
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Enhanced Logging**: Colored terminal output with thought classification

## Tool

### sequential_thinking

Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis with enhanced validation and tracking.

**Required Inputs:**

- `thought` (string): The current thinking step (1-10000 characters)
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number (positive integer)
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed (positive integer)

**Optional Inputs:**

- `isRevision` (boolean): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer): Which thought is being reconsidered (required if isRevision=true)
- `branchFromThought` (integer): Branching point thought number
- `branchId` (string): Branch identifier (1-100 characters, required if branchFromThought specified)
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean): If more thoughts are needed
- `thoughtType` (enum): "hypothesis" or "verification" to classify the thought
- `verificationResult` (enum): "confirmed", "refuted", "partial", or "pending" (only with thoughtType="verification")
- `relatedTo` (array): Array of thought numbers this relates to (max 50 items)
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: `saveSequence`** (object): Save current thoughts as a sequence `{ title: "My Analysis", description: "Optional" }`
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: `loadSequence`** (object): Load a previously saved sequence `{ id: "sequence-id" }`
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: `sequenceId`** (string): ID of the current sequence for automatic persistence

**Enhanced Response:**
The tool now returns comprehensive information including:

- Thought processing status
- Branch information and management
- Memory usage status
- Verification workflow tracking
- Unverified hypotheses detection
- Related thought mapping
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: Current sequence information and persistence status**
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: Sequence management actions (save/load confirmations)**

## Usage

The Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:

- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Hypothesis generation and verification workflows
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: Long-term reasoning projects (business strategy, research planning)**
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: Complex decision-making that evolves over time**
- **ðŸ”¥ NEW: Building on previous insights and conclusions**

## ðŸ”¥ PERSISTENT SEQUENCES USAGE

### Basic Workflow

1. **Normal thinking**: Use the tool as usual for sequential thinking
2. **Save sequence**: Add `saveSequence: { title: "My Analysis" }` to save your progress
3. **Resume later**: Use `loadSequence: { id: "returned-sequence-id" }` to continue
4. **Automatic persistence**: All subsequent thoughts are automatically saved

### Example: Saving a Sequence

```javascript
{
  "thought": "I've completed my initial analysis. Let me save this sequence.",
  "thoughtNumber": 5,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "saveSequence": {
    "title": "Product Strategy Analysis Q2 2025",
    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of our product strategy options"
  }
}
```

### Example: Loading a Sequence

```javascript
{
  "thought": "I want to continue my previous analysis.",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "loadSequence": {
    "id": "seq-abc123def456"
  }
}
```

### Example: Continuing a Loaded Sequence

```javascript
{
  "thought": "Building on my previous analysis, I now see that we need to consider...",
  "thoughtNumber": 6,
  "totalThoughts": 8,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}
// This thought will be automatically saved to the active sequence
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING`: Set to "true" to disable colored thought logging to stderr
- `MAX_THOUGHT_HISTORY`: Maximum number of thoughts to keep in history (default: 1000)
- `MAX_BRANCHES`: Maximum number of branches to maintain (default: 50)
- `MAX_THOUGHTS_PER_BRANCH`: Maximum thoughts per branch (default: 100)

### Database Storage

The server automatically creates and manages a SQLite database at `dist/sequences.db` to store:

- **Sequences**: Metadata including title, description, creation date, and status
- **Thoughts**: Complete thought data with timestamps and sequence relationships
- **Automatic cleanup**: Old sequences and thoughts are managed according to configured limits
- **Cross-session persistence**: All data survives server restarts
