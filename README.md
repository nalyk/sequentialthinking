  <h1>Sequential Thinking MCP Server</h1>
  
Based on concepts from [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers).
</div>

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process with enhanced memory management, type safety, and verification workflows.

## Features

- **Structured Problem Solving**: Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- **Dynamic Revision**: Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens
- **Alternative Reasoning**: Branch into alternative paths of reasoning
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Generate and verify solution hypotheses with result tracking
- **Memory Management**: Configurable limits prevent memory leaks
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Enhanced Logging**: Colored terminal output with thought classification

## Tool

### sequential_thinking

Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis with enhanced validation and tracking.

**Required Inputs:**

- `thought` (string): The current thinking step (1-10000 characters)
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number (positive integer)
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed (positive integer)

**Optional Inputs:**

- `isRevision` (boolean): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer): Which thought is being reconsidered (required if isRevision=true)
- `branchFromThought` (integer): Branching point thought number
- `branchId` (string): Branch identifier (1-100 characters, required if branchFromThought specified)
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean): If more thoughts are needed
- `thoughtType` (enum): "hypothesis" or "verification" to classify the thought
- `verificationResult` (enum): "confirmed", "refuted", "partial", or "pending" (only with thoughtType="verification")
- `relatedTo` (array): Array of thought numbers this relates to (max 50 items)

**Enhanced Response:**
The tool now returns comprehensive information including:

- Thought processing status
- Branch information and management
- Memory usage status
- Verification workflow tracking
- Unverified hypotheses detection
- Related thought mapping

## Usage

The Sequential Thinking tool is designed for:

- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Hypothesis generation and verification workflows
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING`: Set to "true" to disable colored thought logging to stderr
- `MAX_THOUGHT_HISTORY`: Maximum number of thoughts to keep in history (default: 1000)
- `MAX_BRANCHES`: Maximum number of branches to maintain (default: 50)
- `MAX_THOUGHTS_PER_BRANCH`: Maximum thoughts per branch (default: 100)
