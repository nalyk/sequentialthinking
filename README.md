# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

An MCP server implementation that provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through a structured thinking process with advanced hypothesis tracking capabilities.

## üÜï Version 1.1.0 - Enhanced Edition

This version includes significant enhancements over the original implementation, combining the best features of the original modelcontextprotocol/servers architecture with powerful new hypothesis generation and verification capabilities.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. üî¨ Hypothesis Generation & Verification
- **Hypothesis Tracking**: Mark thoughts as hypotheses and track their verification status
- **Related Thoughts**: Link verifications to specific hypotheses
- **Verification Results**: Track confirmation, refutation, partial validation, or pending status
- **Comprehensive Summary**: Get a complete report of all hypotheses and their final states

### 2. üèóÔ∏è Improved Architecture
- **Class-Based Design**: Robust object-oriented architecture from the original
- **Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive input validation with detailed error messages
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery with informative messages
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

### 3. üîß Technical Improvements
- **Dynamic Versioning**: Automatically syncs with package.json version
- **Structured Logging**: Enhanced debugging information with hypothesis status
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimized data structures for better performance
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains full compatibility with existing integrations

## Features

### Core Features
- Break down complex problems into manageable steps
- Revise and refine thoughts as understanding deepens
- Branch into alternative paths of reasoning
- Adjust the total number of thoughts dynamically
- Express uncertainty and explore multiple approaches

### New Features (v1.1.0)
- Generate solution hypotheses with explicit marking
- Verify hypotheses and track verification status
- Link verifications to multiple hypotheses
- Get comprehensive summary reports
- Enhanced error handling and validation

## Tool

### sequential_thinking

Facilitates a detailed, step-by-step thinking process for problem-solving and analysis with hypothesis tracking capabilities.

**Core Parameters:**
- `thought` (string): The current thinking step
- `nextThoughtNeeded` (boolean): Whether another thought step is needed
- `thoughtNumber` (integer): Current thought number (min: 1)
- `totalThoughts` (integer): Estimated total thoughts needed (min: 1)
- `isRevision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous thinking
- `revisesThought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being reconsidered (min: 1)
- `branchFromThought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought number (min: 1)
- `branchId` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needsMoreThoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are needed

**Hypothesis Parameters (New):**
- `thoughtType` (enum, optional): Either "hypothesis" or "verification"
- `relatedTo` (array of integers, optional): Thought numbers this relates to
- `verificationResult` (enum, optional): "confirmed", "refuted", "partial", or "pending"

## Usage Guide

### Basic Sequential Thinking
```javascript
// Regular thinking step
{
  thought: "Let me analyze the problem...",
  thoughtNumber: 1,
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  totalThoughts: 5
}
```

### Hypothesis Generation
```javascript
// Generate a hypothesis
{
  thought: "I believe the root cause is memory leakage",
  thoughtNumber: 2,
  thoughtType: "hypothesis",
  nextThoughtNeeded: true,
  totalThoughts: 5
}
```

### Hypothesis Verification
```javascript
// Verify a hypothesis
{
  thought: "After analyzing the memory dump, the leak is confirmed",
  thoughtNumber: 3,
  thoughtType: "verification",
  relatedTo: [2],  // References thought #2
  verificationResult: "confirmed",
  nextThoughtNeeded: false,
  totalThoughts: 3
}
```

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### npx (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/sequentialthinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Building

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker

Build Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t mcp/sequentialthinking -f Dockerfile .
```

## Example Workflow

1. **Define the Problem**
   ```javascript
   { thought: "Need to analyze why the API is slow", thoughtNumber: 1, nextThoughtNeeded: true }
   ```

2. **Generate Hypotheses**
   ```javascript
   { thought: "Database queries might be unoptimized", thoughtNumber: 2, thoughtType: "hypothesis", nextThoughtNeeded: true }
   { thought: "Network latency could be the issue", thoughtNumber: 3, thoughtType: "hypothesis", nextThoughtNeeded: true }
   ```

3. **Verify Hypotheses**
   ```javascript
   { thought: "Query analysis shows N+1 problem", thoughtNumber: 4, thoughtType: "verification", relatedTo: [2], verificationResult: "confirmed", nextThoughtNeeded: true }
   { thought: "Network tests show normal latency", thoughtNumber: 5, thoughtType: "verification", relatedTo: [3], verificationResult: "refuted", nextThoughtNeeded: false }
   ```

4. **Get Summary**
   ```
   Sequential thinking process complete with 5 thoughts.
   
   Hypotheses: 2
   - #2: confirmed
   - #3: refuted
   ```
