## Configuration

### Transport Modes

The server supports multiple transport methods:

#### 1. STDIO Transport (Recommended for Claude Desktop)
**Status: ‚úÖ Production Ready**

Default and recommended for Claude Desktop integration. Logs automatically redirect to stderr to avoid JSON-RPC corruption.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/sequentialthinking/build/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Streamable HTTP Transport
**Status: ‚úÖ Modern Standard**

For HTTP-based integrations using the latest MCP protocol (replaces deprecated SSE).

```bash
# Enable HTTP transport
export TRANSPORT_HTTP_ENABLED=true
export TRANSPORT_HTTP_PORT=3001
export TRANSPORT_HTTP_HOST=localhost
export TRANSPORT_HTTP_PATH=/api/mcp

# Start server
node build/index.js
```

#### 3. SSE Transport (Legacy)
**Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated - Use Streamable HTTP instead**

Maintained for backwards compatibility only.

Starting with **SDK v1.12.1**, this transport can forward custom request headers during the connection start phase.

```bash
# Enable SSE transport (not recommended)
export TRANSPORT_SSE_ENABLED=true
export TRANSPORT_SSE_PORT=3000
export TRANSPORT_SSE_HOST=localhost
export TRANSPORT_SSE_PATH=/sse

# Start server
node build/index.js
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info                    # trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
LOG_PRETTY_PRINT=true            # Enable pretty printing
LOG_DISABLE_IN_STDIO=false       # Completely disable logs in stdio mode

# Transport Configuration  
TRANSPORT_STDIO_ENABLED=true     # Enable stdio transport
TRANSPORT_HTTP_ENABLED=false     # Enable HTTP transport
TRANSPORT_SSE_ENABLED=false      # Enable deprecated SSE transport

# HTTP Transport Settings
TRANSPORT_HTTP_HOST=localhost
TRANSPORT_HTTP_PORT=3001
TRANSPORT_HTTP_PATH=/api/mcp

# SSE Transport Settings (Deprecated)
TRANSPORT_SSE_HOST=localhost
TRANSPORT_SSE_PORT=3000
TRANSPORT_SSE_PATH=/sse

# Session Configuration
SESSION_TTL=3600                 # Session time-to-live in seconds
SESSION_CHECK_PERIOD=60          # Session cleanup check period
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop

  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/sequentialthinking/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequentialthinking": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "mcp/sequentialthinking"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Example Workflow - ‚úÖ WORKING IMPLEMENTATION

**All examples below are fully functional and working in the current implementation.**

1. **Define the Problem**
   ```javascript
   { thought: "Need to analyze why the API is slow", thoughtNumber: 1, nextThoughtNeeded: true, totalThoughts: 5 }
   ```
   **Server Response**: `"Thought 1 recorded."`

2. **Generate Hypotheses**
   ```javascript
   { thought: "Database queries might be unoptimized", thoughtNumber: 2, thoughtType: "hypothesis", nextThoughtNeeded: true, totalThoughts: 5 }
   { thought: "Network latency could be the issue", thoughtNumber: 3, thoughtType: "hypothesis", nextThoughtNeeded: true, totalThoughts: 5 }
   ```
   **Server Response**: `"Thought 2 recorded. [Hypothesis noted for verification]"`

3. **Verify Hypotheses**
   ```javascript
   { thought: "Query analysis shows N+1 problem", thoughtNumber: 4, thoughtType: "verification", relatedTo: [2], verificationResult: "confirmed", nextThoughtNeeded: true, totalThoughts: 5 }
   { thought: "Network tests show normal latency", thoughtNumber: 5, thoughtType: "verification", relatedTo: [3], verificationResult: "refuted", nextThoughtNeeded: false, totalThoughts: 5 }
   ```
   **Server Response**: `"Thought 4 recorded. [Verification of hypothesis 2 - confirmed]"`

4. **Final Summary (Automatic)**
   ```
   Sequential thinking process complete with 5 thoughts.
   
   Hypotheses: 2
   - Confirmed: 1
   - Refuted: 1
   ```

### ‚úÖ Real Working Features

- **Session Persistence**: Each thinking session maintains complete state
- **Hypothesis Tracking**: All hypotheses are tracked with verification status
- **Validation**: Invalid thought sequences are caught and reported
- **Branching**: Full support for alternative reasoning paths
- **Revision**: Ability to revise previous thoughts with validation

## Acknowledgments

**Version 2.0.0 represents a complete rewrite and modernization** of the original Sequential Thinking server concept. This implementation delivers all promised features with full functionality.

**Key Improvements over Original:**
- ‚úÖ Complete implementation vs. placeholder code
- ‚úÖ Proper MCP SDK integration vs. incorrect API usage  
- ‚úÖ Full hypothesis system vs. missing functionality
- ‚úÖ Production-ready architecture vs. experimental code
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling vs. basic validation

Based on the original Sequential Thinking server concept from [modelcontextprotocol/servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) but completely rewritten with full implementation of all advertised features.
