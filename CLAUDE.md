# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that implements **tools, resources, and prompts** for dynamic and reflective problem-solving. The server provides a structured thinking process that allows for revision, branching, adaptive reasoning, hypothesis testing, and verification workflows. **Updated to MCP Specification 2025-06-18 with latest TypeScript SDK v1.15.0, comprehensive reliability improvements, PERSISTENT SEQUENCES functionality, and FULL MCP CAPABILITIES implementation.**

## Architecture

The project consists of a single main file (`index.ts`) that implements:

- **SequentialThinkingServer class**: Core server logic that manages thought history, branches, validation, memory management, and persistence
- **ThoughtData interface**: Defines the structure for thought data with support for revisions, branching, and verification workflows
- **MCP Server Integration**: Uses the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to create a compliant MCP server
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Memory Management**: Configurable limits and automatic cleanup
- **SQLite Database**: Persistent storage for sequences and thoughts across sessions
- **Sequence Management**: Save, load, and manage thinking sequences over time

The server provides **complete MCP capabilities**:

### 🔥 **RESOURCES** (5 live contextual resources)
- `sequence://current` - Live current sequence data
- `sequences://library` - Browse all saved sequences
- `patterns://analysis` - User thinking patterns analysis with relationship insights
- `verification://status` - Real-time verification dashboard
- `thoughts://recent` - Recent thoughts across all sequences with relationship data

### 🔥 **PROMPTS** (5 professional thinking templates)
- `start_analysis` - Structured analysis framework
- `hypothesis_verification` - Verification workflow template
- `sequence_synthesis` - Synthesis template
- `branch_exploration` - Alternative perspective template
- `problem_decomposition` - Problem breakdown template

### **TOOL** (Sequential thinking with persistence)
The `sequentialthinking` tool facilitates step-by-step problem-solving with the ability to:

- Revise previous thoughts with validation
- Branch into alternative reasoning paths with limits
- Dynamically adjust the total number of thoughts needed
- Maintain context across multiple thinking steps
- **Classify thoughts as hypothesis or verification**
- **Track verification results (confirmed, refuted, partial, pending)**
- **Relate thoughts to previous thoughts for better context**
- **Enhanced visual formatting with colored output for different thought types**
- **Automatic memory management and cleanup**
- **Comprehensive input validation and sanitization**
- **🔥 PERSISTENT SEQUENCES: Save and load thinking sequences across sessions**
- **🔥 SEQUENCE MANAGEMENT: Continue complex reasoning over days or weeks**
- **🔥 AUTOMATIC PERSISTENCE: Thoughts are saved to database when sequence is active**
- **🔥 ENHANCED SEARCH: Full-text search across thought content using SQLite FTS**
- **🔥 EXPORT/IMPORT: Complete sequence backup and sharing capabilities**
- **🔥 RELATIONSHIP INSIGHTS: Enhanced resources show thought connections and patterns**

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the project (compiles TypeScript to JavaScript)
npm run build

# Build with file watching for development
npm run watch

# Prepare the project (runs build automatically)
npm run prepare
```

## Development Setup

The project uses:

- **TypeScript**: Configured for ES2022 target with NodeNext module resolution
- **Output**: Compiled JavaScript goes to `dist/` directory
- **Entry point**: `dist/index.js` (executable binary)
- **Dependencies**: Uses MCP SDK v1.15.0, chalk for colored output, sqlite3 for persistence
- **Database**: SQLite database stored as `dist/sequences.db`
- **Note**: yargs dependency is included but not currently used (reserved for future CLI features)

## Key Implementation Details

### ThoughtData Structure

- **Required fields**: `thought`, `thoughtNumber`, `totalThoughts`, `nextThoughtNeeded`
- **Optional fields**: `isRevision`, `revisesThought`, `branchFromThought`, `branchId`, `needsMoreThoughts`
- **Enhanced optional fields**:
  - `thoughtType`: 'hypothesis' or 'verification' to classify the thought
  - `verificationResult`: 'confirmed', 'refuted', 'partial', or 'pending' for verification thoughts
  - `relatedTo`: Array of thought numbers this thought relates to or builds upon (max 50 items)
- **🔥 NEW: Sequence Management Fields**:
  - `saveSequence`: Object with 'title' and optional 'description' to save current thoughts as a sequence
  - `loadSequence`: Object with 'id' to load a previously saved sequence
  - `searchSequence`: Object with optional 'query', 'limit', and 'contentSearch' to search sequences with fuzzy matching and full-text search
  - `exportSequence`: Object with 'id' to export sequence as JSON
  - `importSequence`: Object with 'data' to import sequence from JSON
  - `sequenceId`: ID of the current sequence (for continuing existing sequences)

### Input Validation & Type Safety

- **Comprehensive validation**: All inputs are validated with descriptive error messages
- **Type guards**: Proper type checking functions instead of unsafe casting
- **Input sanitization**: Removes harmful control characters that could interfere with terminal output
- **Length limits**: Thoughts (1-10000 chars), branch IDs (1-100 chars), related thoughts (max 50)
- **Logical consistency**: Validates relationships (e.g., revisions require target thought, verification results only with verification type)

### Memory Management

- **Configurable limits** via environment variables:
  - `MAX_THOUGHT_HISTORY`: Maximum thoughts in history (default: 1000)
  - `MAX_BRANCHES`: Maximum number of branches (default: 50)
  - `MAX_THOUGHTS_PER_BRANCH`: Maximum thoughts per branch (default: 100)
- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes oldest thoughts/branches when limits exceeded
- **Intelligent branch management**: Keeps most recently active branches
- **Memory status reporting**: Included in tool responses

### Thought Logging

- **Enhanced colored terminal output using chalk:**
  - 💭 Blue for normal thoughts
  - 🔄 Yellow for revisions
  - 🌿 Green for branches
  - 🔬 Cyan for hypothesis thoughts
  - ✅ Magenta for verification thoughts
- Can be disabled with `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING=true` environment variable
- Logs to stderr to avoid interfering with MCP communication
- **Shows related thoughts and verification results in context**
- **Enhanced formatting with borders and structured display**

### Branch Management

- Supports creating alternative reasoning paths
- Maintains separate history for each branch with cleanup
- Branches are identified by string IDs (1-100 characters)
- **Automatic limit enforcement**: Prevents exceeding configured branch limits
- **Branch navigation utilities**: Helper methods for branch management
- **Cleanup based on recency**: Keeps most recently used branches

### Verification Workflow

- **Hypothesis tracking**: Identifies thoughts marked as hypotheses
- **Verification status**: Tracks confirmed, refuted, partial, and pending verifications
- **Unverified hypothesis detection**: Automatically identifies hypotheses needing verification
- **Related thought mapping**: Links verifications to their corresponding hypotheses
- **Workflow reporting**: Includes verification status in tool responses

### 🔥 PERSISTENT SEQUENCES (NEW)

- **SQLite Database**: Stores sequences and thoughts permanently in `dist/sequences.db`
- **Sequence Management**: Create, load, and manage thinking sequences across sessions
- **Automatic Persistence**: When a sequence is active, all thoughts are automatically saved
- **Sequence Operations**:
  - `saveSequence: { title: "My Analysis", description: "Optional description" }` - Save current thoughts as a new sequence
  - `loadSequence: { id: "sequence-id" }` - Load a previously saved sequence into memory
  - Automatic saving when sequence is active
- **Database Schema**:
  - `sequences` table: id, title, description, created, lastModified, status, thoughtCount
  - `thoughts` table: All thought data plus sequenceId, created, modified timestamps
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with all existing features (revisions, branches, verification)
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality works exactly the same

### Error Handling

- **Consistent error responses**: All errors include descriptive messages and timestamps
- **Graceful degradation**: Validation failures don't crash the server
- **Structured error output**: JSON-formatted error responses for MCP clients

## Testing the Server

The server runs on stdio and communicates using the MCP protocol. It can be tested by:

1. Building the project: `npm run build`
2. Running the executable: `./dist/index.js`
3. Sending MCP-formatted requests for tool listing and tool calls

**Example test startup:**

```bash
timeout 3s ./dist/index.js 2>&1 || echo "Server startup test completed"
```

## 🔥 PERSISTENT SEQUENCES USAGE EXAMPLES

### Saving a Sequence

```javascript
// After thinking through several thoughts, save them as a sequence
{
  "thought": "This completes my analysis. Let me save this sequence.",
  "thoughtNumber": 5,
  "totalThoughts": 5,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "saveSequence": {
    "title": "Product Strategy Analysis",
    "description": "Comprehensive analysis of our product strategy for Q2 2025"
  }
}
```

### Loading a Sequence

```javascript
// Load a previously saved sequence to continue work
{
  "thought": "I want to continue my previous analysis.",
  "thoughtNumber": 1,
  "totalThoughts": 1,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "loadSequence": {
    "id": "seq-123456"
  }
}
```

### Continuing a Loaded Sequence

```javascript
// After loading, continue adding thoughts (automatically saved)
{
  "thought": "Building on my previous analysis, I now realize...",
  "thoughtNumber": 6,
  "totalThoughts": 8,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true
}
```

### Typical Workflow

1. **Start thinking** - Use normal sequential thinking
2. **Save sequence** - When ready to pause: `saveSequence: { title: "My Analysis" }`
3. **Find sequence** - Search your work: `searchSequence: { query: "analysis", contentSearch: true }`
4. **Resume later** - Load sequence: `loadSequence: { id: "found-sequence-id" }`
5. **Continue thinking** - All new thoughts automatically saved to sequence
6. **Build complex insights** - Work on the same problem over days/weeks
7. **🎆 NEW: Export/Import** - Use `exportSequence`/`importSequence` for backup/sharing

### 🔍 Sequence Search Examples

```javascript
// Search with fuzzy matching (Romanian/Russian diacritics supported)
{
  "searchSequence": {
    "query": "strategia",     // finds "Strategia de dezvoltare"
    "limit": 10
  }
}

// NEW: Search within thought content using FTS
{
  "searchSequence": {
    "query": "market analysis",
    "limit": 10,
    "contentSearch": true    // searches within thought content
  }
}

// List all sequences (no query)
{
  "searchSequence": {
    "limit": 20
  }
}
```

## Important Instruction Reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
Claude Code CLI does not have hot realod, so to really test it for your self, you (yes you,m Claude) need to be restarted.
