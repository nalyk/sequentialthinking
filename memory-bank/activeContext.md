## Current Focus

- Preparing to implement the modernization plan for the Sequential Thinking MCP Server
- Focusing on creating a self-contained application without external dependencies
- Designing a flexible configuration system for transport method selection

## Recent Changes

- Initialized Memory Bank to track project progress and decisions
- Analyzed current implementation of the Sequential Thinking MCP Server
- Created comprehensive modernization plan (mcp-server-modernization-plan.md)
- Decided to use node-cache instead of Redis for session management
- Decided to use built-in health endpoints instead of OpenTelemetry for monitoring
- Designed configuration system for enabling/disabling transport methods

## Open Questions/Issues

- How to best implement the factory pattern for transport creation
- What specific health metrics should be included in the monitoring endpoints
- How to structure the test suite for comprehensive coverage

# Active Context for Sequential Thinking MCP Server

## Current Focus

2025-05-22 16:08:12 - Implementing the modernized Sequential Thinking MCP Server with multi-transport support.

The current focus is on implementing the core architecture for the modernized Sequential Thinking MCP Server as outlined in the modernization plan. This includes:

1. Setting up the modular project structure
2. Implementing the transport abstraction layer
3. Creating the session management system
4. Implementing the configuration system
5. Setting up the logging system
6. Creating the main server class and entry point

## Recent Changes

2025-05-22 16:08:12 - Completed the initial implementation of the modernized server architecture.

- Created modular directory structure
- Implemented transport interface and base class
- Created transport factory for dynamic transport creation
- Implemented session manager using node-cache
- Set up logging system using Pino
- Created configuration system using convict and dotenv
- Implemented main server class and entry point
- Added placeholder implementations for SSE and HTTP transports

## Open Questions/Issues

2025-05-22 16:08:12 - The following questions/issues need to be addressed:

1. **SDK Compatibility**: The current SDK version (1.11.5) may not fully support all transport methods. Need to investigate how to properly implement SSE and HTTP transports with this version.

2. **Tool Registration**: The current implementation uses a workaround for registering the sequential thinking tool handler. Need to find the proper API for this in the SDK.

3. **Testing**: Need to implement comprehensive tests for all components.

4. **Documentation**: Need to update the README and create API documentation.

## Recent Changes

2025-05-22 16:14:15 - Fixed ES module import issue in the logger.ts file.

- Fixed an issue with CommonJS-style imports in an ES module project
- Updated logger.ts to use ES module import syntax (`import { pino } from 'pino'}`)
- Installed missing pino-pretty package for logger transport
- Successfully built and ran the application
