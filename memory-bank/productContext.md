## Project Goal

- Modernize the Sequential Thinking MCP Server by implementing the latest Model Context Protocol features and SDK capabilities while preserving the existing functionality.
- Transform the application into a state-of-the-art MCP server that leverages modern protocol capabilities.
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing integrations.

## Key Features

- Sequential thinking tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving
- Hypothesis generation and verification capabilities
- Structured thinking process with advanced tracking
- Class-based architecture with robust error handling
- TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## Overall Architecture

- Node.js application using TypeScript
- MCP server implementation with SDK integration
- Currently uses StdioServerTransport for communication
- Provides a single tool: "sequential_thinking"

2025-05-22 15:50:00 - Updated modernization plan

## Planned Modernization

- Support for all three transport methods (stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP)
- Upgrade to latest MCP SDK (2.0.0+)
- Enhanced session management with node-cache (no external dependencies)
- Improved error handling and logging with Pino
- Built-in health endpoints for monitoring (no external dependencies)
- Flexible configuration system using dotenv and convict

## Configuration System

The configuration system will allow users to choose which transport methods to enable through:

1. Default values defined in schema
2. Configuration files (config/default.json, config/development.json, config/production.json)
3. Environment variables (using dotenv to load from .env file)
4. Command-line arguments

Users can enable/disable any transport method and customize endpoints for HTTP-based transports.

# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

## Project Overview

The Sequential Thinking MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a dynamic, step-by-step "Sequential Thinking" tool for AI systems. This tool helps AI systems break down complex problems into sequential steps, with support for revisions, branching, and hypothesis verification.

## Modernization Goals

The modernization project aims to transform the Sequential Thinking MCP Server into a state-of-the-art Model Context Protocol server while maintaining backward compatibility with existing integrations. The key goals are:

1. **Multi-Transport Support**: Implement and maintain all three transport methods (stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP)
2. **SDK Version Upgrade**: Update to the latest SDK version with all new capabilities
3. **Architecture Enhancement**: Improve session management and error handling
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement modern protocol features for better performance
5. **Configuration Flexibility**: Allow users to choose which transport(s) to enable

## Core Features

- **Sequential Thinking Tool**: A tool that helps AI systems break down complex problems into steps
- **Multi-Transport Support**: Support for stdio, SSE, and HTTP transport methods
- **Session Management**: In-memory session storage with TTL support
- **Configuration System**: Schema validation and hierarchical configuration
- **Logging System**: Structured logging with different log levels

## Technology Stack

- **Core**: TypeScript, Node.js
- **MCP SDK**: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **HTTP Server**: Fastify
- **Session Management**: node-cache
- **Logging**: Pino
- **Configuration**: convict, dotenv

## Architecture

The Sequential Thinking MCP Server uses a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Transport Layer**: Handles communication with clients using different transport methods
2. **Session Management**: Manages client sessions and state
3. **Tool Implementation**: Implements the sequential thinking tool
4. **Configuration System**: Manages server configuration
5. **Logging System**: Provides structured logging

## Current Status

The initial implementation of the modernized server architecture is complete. This includes:

- Modular project structure
- Transport abstraction layer
- Session management system
- Configuration system
- Logging system
- Main server class and entry point

The next steps are to implement comprehensive tests, update documentation, and address any remaining issues with the SDK compatibility.
