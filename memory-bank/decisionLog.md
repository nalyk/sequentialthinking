## Decision

- Initialize Memory Bank to track project progress and decisions

## Rationale

- The project involves modernizing an existing MCP server with significant architectural changes
- Memory Bank will help track decisions, progress, and context throughout the modernization process
- Provides a structured way to document the evolution of the project

## Implementation Details

- Created memory-bank directory with standard files:
  - productContext.md: Overview of the project and goals
  - activeContext.md: Current status and open questions
  - progress.md: Task tracking and next steps
  - decisionLog.md: Architectural decisions and rationale
  - systemPatterns.md: Patterns and standards used in the project

## Decision

- Use node-cache instead of Redis for session storage

## Rationale

- Eliminates external dependency on Redis
- Makes the application self-contained and autonomous
- Provides similar functionality (TTL, fast in-memory storage)
- Simplifies deployment and operation

## Implementation Details

- Use node-cache for in-memory session storage with TTL support
- Configure session initialization and cleanup
- Implement proper error handling for session management

## Decision

- Use built-in health endpoints instead of OpenTelemetry for monitoring

## Rationale

- Eliminates external dependency on monitoring infrastructure
- Makes the application self-contained and autonomous
- Provides basic monitoring capabilities sufficient for most use cases
- Simplifies deployment and operation

## Implementation Details

- Create health check endpoints for basic monitoring
- Implement status checks for all components
- Provide basic performance metrics

2025-05-22 16:07:53 - Decision to implement a modular architecture with multiple transport support

**Decision**: Implement a modular architecture with support for multiple transport methods (stdio, SSE, and HTTP).

**Rationale**:

- The modernization plan requires support for all three transport methods
- A modular architecture allows for better maintainability and extensibility
- Each transport can be enabled/disabled independently via configuration
- This approach allows for backward compatibility with existing integrations

**Implications**:

- Need to create a common interface for all transport types
- Need to implement a factory pattern for transport creation
- Configuration system must support enabling/disabling each transport
- Server must be able to handle multiple active transports simultaneously

2025-05-22 16:07:53 - Decision to use placeholder implementations for SSE and HTTP transports

**Decision**: Implement placeholder implementations for SSE and HTTP transports due to SDK limitations.

**Rationale**:

- The current SDK version (1.11.5) may not fully support these transport methods
- We need to maintain backward compatibility with the existing implementation
- Placeholders allow for future implementation when the SDK is updated

**Implications**:

- SSE and HTTP transports will be disabled by default
- Need to add clear TODO comments for future implementation
- The architecture must be flexible enough to accommodate future changes

2025-05-22 16:07:53 - Decision to use node-cache for session management

**Decision**: Use node-cache for in-memory session storage.

**Rationale**:

- Simple implementation with no external dependencies
- Provides TTL support for automatic session expiration
- Fast performance for in-memory caching
- Event-based API for handling session events

**Implications**:

- Sessions will be lost if the server restarts
- Need to implement proper session cleanup
- Need to handle session events (expired, deleted, etc.)

2025-05-22 16:07:53 - Decision to use convict for configuration management

**Decision**: Use convict for schema validation and hierarchical configuration.

**Rationale**:

- Provides schema validation for configuration values
- Supports hierarchical configuration
- Supports environment-specific configuration
- Integrates well with dotenv for environment variables

**Implications**:

- Need to define a comprehensive configuration schema
- Need to provide sensible default values for all configuration options
- Configuration can be overridden via environment variables

---

2025-05-22 16:14:30 - Decision to use ES module imports consistently throughout the project

**Decision**: Use ES module imports consistently throughout the project instead of CommonJS require statements.

**Rationale**:

- The project is configured as an ES module project with `"type": "module"` in package.json
- ES modules are the standard module system for modern JavaScript
- Mixing CommonJS and ES module syntax causes runtime errors
- ES modules provide better static analysis and tree-shaking capabilities

**Implications**:

- All import statements must use ES module syntax (`import x from 'y'`)
- No use of `require()` statements in the codebase
- Need to ensure all dependencies support ES modules
- May need to adjust import paths to include file extensions (e.g., `.js`)
