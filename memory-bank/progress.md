## Completed Tasks

- Analyzed current implementation of the Sequential Thinking MCP Server
- Identified the current SDK version (1.10.1) and transport method (StdioServerTransport)
- Initialized Memory Bank to track project progress
- Researched latest Model Context Protocol features and SDK capabilities
- Created comprehensive modernization plan (mcp-server-modernization-plan.md)
- Designed configuration system for transport method selection
- Made key architectural decisions (node-cache for sessions, built-in health endpoints)

## Current Tasks

- Preparing to implement the modernization plan
- Updating Memory Bank with project context and decisions
- Finalizing implementation details for the configuration system

## Next Steps

- Switch to Code mode to begin implementation
- Set up project structure and configuration system
- Implement transport layer abstraction with factory pattern
- Upgrade to the latest SDK version
- Implement all three transport methods
- Enhance session management with node-cache
- Create health endpoints for monitoring

2025-05-22 15:54:00 - Starting implementation of the modernization plan. Beginning with Phase 1: Project Setup and SDK Upgrade.

2025-05-22 15:54:41 - Updated package.json with new dependencies: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v2.0.0, convict, dotenv, fastify, node-cache, pino, and uuid. Also updated version to 2.0.0 to reflect the major update.

2025-05-22 15:58:01 - Updated package.json to use the latest available version of @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (1.11.5) instead of the non-existent 2.0.0 version. Successfully installed all dependencies.

2025-05-22 15:58:21 - Created modular directory structure for the project:

- src/transports/ - For transport implementations
  - src/transports/stdio/ - For StdioServerTransport
  - src/transports/sse/ - For SSEServerTransport
  - src/transports/http/ - For StreamableHTTPServerTransport
- src/session/ - For session management
- src/logging/ - For logging
- src/tools/ - For the sequential thinking tool

2025-05-22 16:07:27 - Implemented the modernized Sequential Thinking MCP Server with the following components:

1. Created modular directory structure:

   - src/transports/ - For transport implementations
     - src/transports/stdio/ - For StdioServerTransport
     - src/transports/sse/ - For SSEServerTransport
     - src/transports/http/ - For StreamableHTTPServerTransport
   - src/session/ - For session management
   - src/logging/ - For logging
   - src/tools/ - For the sequential thinking tool
   - src/config/ - For configuration management

2. Implemented core components:

   - Transport interface and base class
   - Transport factory for creating transport instances
   - Session manager using node-cache
   - Logging system using Pino
   - Configuration system using convict and dotenv
   - Main server class
   - Application entry point

3. Added support for multiple transport methods:

   - StdioServerTransport for CLI clients
   - SSEServerTransport for legacy web clients (placeholder)
   - StreamableHTTPServerTransport for modern web clients (placeholder)

4. Implemented configuration flexibility:
   - Environment variables for all configuration options
   - Default configuration values
   - Schema validation for configuration

     2025-05-22 16:13:48 - Fixed ES module import issue in logger.ts
     |

- Identified and fixed an issue with CommonJS-style imports in an ES module project
- Updated logger.ts to use ES module import syntax (`import { pino } from 'pino'`)
- Installed missing pino-pretty package for logger transport
- Successfully built and ran the application
