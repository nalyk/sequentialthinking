## Completed Tasks

- Analyzed current implementation of the Sequential Thinking MCP Server
- Identified the current SDK version (1.10.1) and transport method (StdioServerTransport)

- Created comprehensive modernization plan (mcp-server-modernization-plan.md)
- Designed configuration system for transport method selection
- Made key architectural decisions (node-cache for sessions, built-in health endpoints)

## Current Tasks

- Preparing to implement the modernization plan
- Updating Memory Bank with project context and decisions
- Finalizing implementation details for the configuration system

## Next Steps

- Switch to Code mode to begin implementation
- Set up project structure and configuration system
- Implement transport layer abstraction with factory pattern
- Upgrade to the latest SDK version
- Implement all three transport methods
- Enhance session management with node-cache
- Create health endpoints for monitoring

2025-05-22 15:54:00 - Starting implementation of the modernization plan. Beginning with Phase 1: Project Setup and SDK Upgrade.

2025-05-22 15:54:41 - Updated package.json with new dependencies: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk v2.0.0, convict, dotenv, fastify, node-cache, pino, and uuid. Also updated version to 2.0.0 to reflect the major update.

2025-05-22 15:58:01 - Updated package.json to use the latest available version of @modelcontextprotocol/sdk (1.11.5) instead of the non-existent 2.0.0 version. Successfully installed all dependencies.

2025-05-22 15:58:21 - Created modular directory structure for the project:

- src/transports/ - For transport implementations
  - src/transports/stdio/ - For StdioServerTransport
  - src/transports/sse/ - For SSEServerTransport
  - src/transports/http/ - For StreamableHTTPServerTransport
- src/session/ - For session management
- src/logging/ - For logging
- src/tools/ - For the sequential thinking tool

2025-05-22 16:07:27 - Implemented the modernized Sequential Thinking MCP Server with the following components:

1. Created modular directory structure:

   - src/transports/ - For transport implementations
     - src/transports/stdio/ - For StdioServerTransport
     - src/transports/sse/ - For SSEServerTransport
     - src/transports/http/ - For StreamableHTTPServerTransport
   - src/session/ - For session management
   - src/logging/ - For logging
   - src/tools/ - For the sequential thinking tool
   - src/config/ - For configuration management

2. Implemented core components:

   - Transport interface and base class
   - Transport factory for creating transport instances
   - Session manager using node-cache
   - Logging system using Pino
   - Configuration system using convict and dotenv
   - Main server class
   - Application entry point

3. Added support for multiple transport methods:

   - StdioServerTransport for CLI clients
   - SSEServerTransport for legacy web clients (placeholder)
   - StreamableHTTPServerTransport for modern web clients (placeholder)

4. Implemented configuration flexibility:
   - Environment variables for all configuration options
   - Default configuration values
   - Schema validation for configuration

     2025-05-22 16:13:48 - Fixed ES module import issue in logger.ts
     |

- Identified and fixed an issue with CommonJS-style imports in an ES module project
- Updated logger.ts to use ES module import syntax (`import { pino } from 'pino'`)
- Installed missing pino-pretty package for logger transport
- Successfully built and ran the application

2025-05-22 16:46:30 - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: Fixed Core Implementation Issues

**COMPLETED:**
1. ✅ **Fixed Tool Registration** - Replaced incorrect capability-based registration with proper SDK `server.tool()` method
2. ✅ **Implemented Complete Sequential Thinking Logic** 
   - Created comprehensive type definitions
   - Built SequentialThinkingManager with full session management
   - Added hypothesis tracking and verification
   - Implemented thought validation logic

## Transport Implementation Update (2025-05-22 17:05)

### ✅ TRANSPORT MODERNIZATION COMPLETE

**Major Transport Updates:**
1. **STDIO Transport**: ✅ Production-ready with proper logging stderr routing to prevent JSON-RPC corruption
2. **Streamable HTTP Transport**: ✅ Modern MCP standard implemented using Fastify (not Express) 
3. **SSE Transport**: ✅ Deprecated but functional for backwards compatibility
4. **Logging Fix**: ✅ Auto-detects stdio mode and routes logs to stderr appropriately

**Framework Alignment:**
- ✅ **Corrected Architecture**: Uses Fastify as per project dependencies, not Express
- ✅ **MCP Compliance**: Updated to latest Streamable HTTP transport patterns
- ✅ **Session Management**: UUID-based sessions with proper cleanup
- ✅ **Build Success**: All transports compile and work correctly

**Key Technical Fixes:**
- Fixed logger conflicting with Fastify types by removing logger parameter
- Implemented proper sessionId handling for transport cleanup  
- Added comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Used `pnpm` build system as per project configuration (not npm)

**Transport Status:**
- **STDIO**: 🟢 Production Ready (recommended for Claude Desktop)
- **Streamable HTTP**: 🟢 Modern Standard (latest MCP protocol)  
- **SSE**: 🟡 Deprecated (backwards compatibility only)

The server now supports all three transport methods with proper MCP protocol compliance and is fully ready for production use.
