# System Patterns _Optional_

This file documents recurring patterns and standards used in the project.
It is optional, but recommended to be updated as the project evolves.

## Coding Patterns

- Class-based architecture for the MCP server
- TypeScript with proper interfaces for type safety
- Comprehensive input validation with detailed error messages
- Enhanced error handling with graceful recovery

## Architectural Patterns

- Model Context Protocol server implementation
- Multi-transport support (stdio, SSE, and Streamable HTTP)
- Factory pattern for transport creation
- Dependency injection for better testability
- Configuration-driven architecture
- Self-contained application without external dependencies
- Single tool implementation: "sequential_thinking"
- Hypothesis generation and verification tracking

2025-05-22 15:51:00 - Added new architectural patterns for modernization

## Testing Patterns

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for each transport method
- End-to-end tests for the entire system
- Performance benchmarking for each transport method

2025-05-22 16:07:41 - Implemented the following architectural patterns in the Sequential Thinking MCP Server:

## Factory Pattern

- Implemented in `TransportFactory` class
- Creates appropriate transport instances based on configuration
- Allows for dynamic creation of different transport types
- Centralizes transport creation logic

## Strategy Pattern

- Used for transport implementations
- Common `Transport` interface for all transport types
- Different strategies (StdioTransport, SSETransport, HTTPTransport) implement the same interface
- Allows for interchangeable transport mechanisms

## Dependency Injection

- Logger, configuration, and other dependencies injected into components
- Improves testability and reduces coupling
- Makes components more modular and reusable

## Configuration Management Pattern

- Hierarchical configuration using convict
- Environment variable overrides
- Schema validation for configuration values
- Default values for all configuration options

## Observer Pattern

- Used in session management for event handling
- Cache events (expired, deleted, flushed) trigger appropriate handlers
- Decouples event generation from event handling

## Singleton Pattern

- Used for logger and configuration instances
- Ensures only one instance exists throughout the application
- Provides global access to these instances
